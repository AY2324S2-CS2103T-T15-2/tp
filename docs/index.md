AronaPro is a **desktop app** catered primarily for Computing Professors and Teaching Assistants(TAs) to manage your students/professors/TAs contacts efficiently, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Our product ensures that you can always centralise their contacts, connect and coordinate with them.
