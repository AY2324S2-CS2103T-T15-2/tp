### Project: AronaPro

AronaPro is a desktop application designed for tech-savvy university Computer Science teaching assistants,
enabling them to enjoy an organised and vibrant approach to query, and manage an array of students and professorsâ€™
contacts via the Command Line Interface (CLI).

My contributions to the project are listed below

* **New Feature**: Added a schedule command.
    * What it does: allows the user to add a schedule with someone in the contact list.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to keep track of their schedule with someone in the contact list.

* **Code contributed**: [https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2024-02-23&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Rikko1204&tabRepo=AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false]()
