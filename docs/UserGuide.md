## About UserGuide

Welcome to our User Guide! Here, we have got everything you need to know about using all of our application's features. 
If you are already familiar with our application, dive straight into the [Features](#features) section to discover more. 
However, if you are new to the application, we have got you covered. You can simply do so by following our guide step-by-step, 
starting with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section, to quickly get up to speed with AronaPro before you start your own adventure. 
Let us get started!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `aronapro.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/releases). 

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for AronaPro in your desired location. For demonstration purpose, we will save the downloaded jar file into `test` folder and saved it to `Desktop` on either Mac or Windows machines. 

1. Open a command terminal, either by typing `terminal` on Mac or `PowerShell` on windows and perform the following steps to reach the `test` folder created earlier in order to run the application:
   1. First type `ls` to see what are all the folders in your current directory.
   2. Type `cd <file_name>` where the file name refers to the file name you are trying to enter. One tip is that file name can be auto-completed simply by typing the first few letters and hitting `Tab`.
   3. Repeat i. and ii. above until you see the `test` folder and `cd` into it as show in the sequence of diagrams for both Mac and Windows machines below:

    <img src="images/UserGuide/Navigation step three.png" alt="Navigation step three" width="900" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top:30px"/>
   </p>  
   
1. Lastly, enter the command: `java -jar aronapro.jar` to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.<br>
   <p align="centerleft">
    <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" width="900" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top:20px"/>
   </p>
   e.g. Typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try to quickly get started with our application:

   * `view` : Lists all contacts.


   * `add id/E1234567 n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com t/Student g/CS2103T-T15` : Adds a student with `NAME` John Doe with `NUSID` of E1234567 to AronaPro.

   * `delete id/E1234567` : Deletes the person with `NUSID` of E1234567.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

### **Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  > `delete id/NUSID`, `NUSID` is a parameter which need to be supplied.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  > `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or simply as `n/John Doe` without specifying the `TAG` as it is optional.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times or zero times.<br>
  > `[g/GROUP]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times) or `g/School` `g/Family`, demonstrating that group can be used two times by writing them successively on the same line etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  > If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `view`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  > If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

> * The EMAIL search uses a PARTIAL, case-insensitive match. (e.g. `charles` matches `PrinceCharles@kingston.com`).
> * The TAG search uses an EXACT case-sensitive match. 
> * The GROUP search fetches people with ALL specified groups (e.g `g/CS2101 g/CS2103T` matches a person who minimally has BOTH these Groups).
> * Persons matching all parameters will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AronaPro data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

All data from the application is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AronaPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause AronaPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **When using the `schedule` command**, the command does not check for the validity of the date entered. Hence, it is important to ensure that the date entered is valid.
3. **When using the `schedule` command**, the command does not check if the valid date entered is in the future. Hence, it is important to ensure that the date entered is in the future.
4. **When using the `edit` command**, the command does not check for the validity of the domain name of the email entered as writing an incorrect domain name after the `@` is accepted (e.g. `@random.com`). Hence, it is important to ensure that a valid domain name is entered.
4. **When using the `group` command with a very long group name**, the group name may be hidden from view. The remedy is to resize the window to view the full group name.
5. **When adding/editing a person's email address with a very long email address**, the email address may be hidden from view. The remedy is to resize the window to view the full email address.
6. **When resizing the window to a smaller size**, the GUI may not fully display the person's information; for example: name, tag, remark. The remedy is to resize the window to a larger size to view all the information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Planned enhancements

Team size: 5

1. **Validity of date entered:** The current behaviour of the `schedule` command does not check for the validity of the date entered. We plan to implement a check to ensure that the date entered is valid.
2. **Future date check:** The current behaviour of the `schedule` command does not check if the valid date entered is in the future. We plan to implement a check to ensure that the date entered is in the future.
3. **Validity of email domain entered:** The current behaviour of the `edit` command does not check for the validity of the domain name of the email entered. We plan to implement a check to ensure that a valid domain name is entered.
3. **Group name visibility:** When using the `group` command with a very long group name, the group name may be hidden from view. We plan to implement a feature to allow users to view the full group name. Either by truncating the group name, allowing the user to view the full group name or limiting the length of the group name.
4. **Email address visibility:** When adding/editing a person's email address with a very long email address, the email address may be hidden from view. We plan to implement a feature to allow users to view the full email address. Either by truncating the email address, allowing the user to view the full email address or limiting the length of the email address.
5. **Tag information visibility:** When resizing the window to a smaller size, the GUI may not fully display the person's tag information. We plan to implement a minimum size for the window to ensure that all information is displayed.
6. **Tag case sensitivity:** When editing tags, the valid forms have to be either 1 of these:  Professor, TA, Student, None. We plan to implement a feature to allow users to enter tags in any case (e.g., professor, ta, student, none) and still be recognised as valid tags.
